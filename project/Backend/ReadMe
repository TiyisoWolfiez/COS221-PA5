Here's a list of all the functions the API needs to do and the corresponding JS, please add whatever else needs to be done:
Once something is working add an X to the end of the point so we know not to work on it anymore.

API:
-Can get winery data
    -All 
    -All sorted by location
    -All south african (if user is foreign)
    -All foreign (if user is southAfrican)
    -All sorted by distance away from user
-Can get wine data
	-All
    -Filtered by a given Appellation, Varietal, Colour, Carbonation, Sweetness, Country
    -Sorted by price, rating, alcohol content, vintage, year_bottled
    -Both filtered and sorted 
-Can get user data
-Can get review data
-Can return whether login credentials were correct X
-Can return whether admin key was correct
-Can return list of all appellations
-Can return list of all varietals
-Can return list of all countries
-Can return a winery’s site, address, location
-Can return all the wines of a specific winery
-Can return a winery given a wine
-Update winery information
-Update wine information, delete wines, insert wines
-Insert new users, delete users
-Update user’s username

I think we should add some sort of key to alter, insert, delete statements for security - I was thinking just the manager’s password/ the admin key?


JS:
-Implement buttons
-Pages populated from API on page load
-When filters applied in winery, contacts API and populates page
-When filters applied in wine, contacts API and populates page
-Populates single wine page (wine info + reviews)
-Populates view winery page
-Populates winery management page
-Populates admin management page
-Contacts API for login and signup
